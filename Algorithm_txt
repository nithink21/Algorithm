Algorithm
1st way -Algorithm to find Second Largest Number in Array.
1.	Take input numbers into Array.
2.	Find the total numbers in array.
3.	Sort the Array (use sort()).
4.	Print the Array[n-2] number.
----------------------------------------------------------
2nd way- Algorithm to find Second Largest Number in Array.
1.	Take input numbers into Array
2.	Take two variables 1st max=INT_MIN and 2nd max=INT_MIN
3.	Iterate through array if current value in array is greater than 1st max then update 2nd max = 1st max and 1st max=current value in array
4.	After completing 3rd step, Print 2ndmax.
