Coding Standards

Good software development organizations want their programmers to maintain to some well-defined and standard style of coding called coding standards. They usually make their own coding standards and guidelines depending on what suits their organization best and based on the types of software they develop. It is very important for the programmers to maintain the coding standards otherwise the code will be rejected during code review.
Purpose of Having Coding Standards:
A coding standard gives a uniform appearance to the codes written by different engineers.
It improves readability, and maintainability of the code and it reduces complexity also.
It helps in code reuse and helps to detect error easily.
It promotes sound programming practices and increases efficiency of the programmers.

Coding Standards:

1.	Limited use of global. 
2.	Standard headers for different modules
3.	Naming conventions for local variables, global variables, constants and functions
4.	Indentation
5.	Error return values and exception handling conventions
6.	Avoid using a coding style that is too difficult to understand
7.	Avoid using an identifier for multiple purposes
8.	Code should be well documented
9.	Length of functions should not be very large
10.	Try not to use GOTO statement


Advantages of Coding Guidelines:

Coding guidelines increase the efficiency of the software and reduces the development time.
Coding guidelines help in detecting errors in the early phases, so it helps to reduce the extra cost incurred by the software project.
If coding guidelines are maintained properly, then the software code increases readability and understandability thus it reduces the complexity of the code.
It reduces the hidden cost for developing the software.
